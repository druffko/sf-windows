## San Francisco
San Francisco is an Apple designed typeface that provides a consistent, legible, and friendly typographic voice. Across all Apple products, the size-specific outlines and dynamic tracking ensure optimal legibility at every point size and screen resolution. Numbers have proportional widths by default, so they feel harmonious and naturally spaced within the time and data-centric interfaces people use every day.

Nine weights, including italics — and features like small caps, fractions, inferior and superior numerals, indices, arrows, and more — offer breadth and depth for precision typesetting. San Francisco also adapts intelligently to different contexts. When indicating time, for example, the colon in San Francisco switches to a vertically centered form. And each operating system works with the typeface to apply size-specific font features automatically.

### SF Pro
This neutral, flexible, sans-serif typeface is the system font for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and tvOS. SF Pro features nine weights, variable optical sizes for optimal legibility, four widths, and includes a rounded variant. SF Pro supports over 150 languages across Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.

### SF Compact
Sharing many features with SF Pro, SF Compact features an efficient, compact design that is optimized for small sizes and narrow columns. SF Compact is the system font for watchOS and includes a rounded variant.

### SF Mono
This monospaced variant of San Francisco enables alignment between rows and columns of text, and is used in coding environments like Xcode. SF Mono features six weights and supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.

### New York
A companion to San Francisco, this serif typeface is based on essential aspects of historical type styles. New York features six weights, supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts, and features variable optical sizes allowing it to perform as a traditional reading face at small sizes and a graphic display face at larger sizes.

## SF Script Extensions
Like San Francisco, these extensions to the Apple system font feature nine weights, a rounded variant, and variable optical sizes that automatically adjust spacing and proportion based on the point size.

Each script extension has been designed to fit with SF Pro for multilingual typesetting, while respecting the natural proportions for each script by adjusting weight, contrast, and vertical metrics.

### SF Arabic
A contemporary interpretation of the Naskh style with a rational and flexible design.

### SF Armenian
Designed with proportions that have been adjusted for a better visual balance in multilingual typesetting.

### SF Georgian
Supports modern Georgian, Mkhedruli, and Mtavruli uppercase forms.

### SF Hebrew
With full support of the Niqqud diacritical marks.
